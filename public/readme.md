Once you change something in VS Code and want to update it on GitHub, you need to follow these steps (in the terminal inside VS Code):

## Check Status
```git status```
## Add changed files
```git add .```
## Commit with a message
```git commit -m "Your Message"```
## Push to Github
```git push origin main```
